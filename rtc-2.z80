assembly code for interfacing an RTC with the CA80 system via I2C is quite detailed and handles multiple aspects
of the I2C protocol and the RTC read-write operations. 

Changes made:

1. Created a modular routine `INIT_PORT` to initialize the 8255 port. This avoids duplication and centralizes changes.
2. Moved `GETTIME` to a separate subroutine so that it can be called from `GET_RTC`, improving modularity.
3. Wrapped the get and save logic for time data in loops (`GETTIME_LOOP` and `SAVETIME_LOOP`). This makes it easier to read and maintain.

Note: I've only shown the revised code for the `GET_RTC` and `SAVETIME` procedures for brevity. 
You would still need to include the rest of the procedures like `WAIT_4`, `SET_ADDR`, etc. 
The changes aimed to improve readability, reusability, and maintainability.
